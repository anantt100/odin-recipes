    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Poha (flattened rice) is typically a Western Indian breakfast recipe but it’s taste and ease of making has made it extremely popular all over India.</p>
    <p>Poha is very easy to make, it requires almost no cooking, the flattened rice just need to be rinsed till it’s softened and that’s about it.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1.5 cups poha 114 grams, use thick poha </li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon turmeric </li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon + 1/8 teaspoon salt divided, adjust to taste </li>
        <li>1/3 cup green peas I used frozen, soaked in warm water for 10 minutes </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons oil 10 ml, I used avocado oil </li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds </li>
        <li>1.5 tablespoons raw peanuts</li>
        <li>1 small red onion chopped</li>
        <li>1 green chili chopped</li>
        <li>10-12 curry leaves</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon sugar optional</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped cilantro + more to garnish</li>
        <li>1/2 lemon juice of</li>
        <li>sev to garnish</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To a strainer, add flattened rice (poha). Rinse it under running water until it turns soft. To check if it's done, press a flake between your thumb and index finger, it should break easily.</li>
        <li>Add turmeric and 1/2 teaspoon salt to the poha and toss to combine. Set it aside while you make the tempering in the pan.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a pan on medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the mustard seeds and let them pop.</li>
        <li>Then add the peanuts and saute for a minute or two until they start turning brown.</li>
        <li>Then add the chopped onion, green chili and curry leaves. Cook for 2 minutes until the onions soften.</li>
        <li>Add the green peas (which had been soaked in warm water for 10 minutes prior) and mix. Cook for 2 minutes until raw smell of peas goes away.</li>
        <li><p></p>Then add in the rinsed poha and toss to combine. Taste test some poha and if it feels dry, sprinkle little water all over (I usually do that). Cook for 1-2 minutes.  Also tastes test and add more salt as needed at this point (I added around 1/8 teaspoon). 
            <p>Also add the sugar (if using) and cilantro.</p></li>
        <li>And then cover the pan with a lid and turn heat to low. Let it be like that for 2 minutes. Then turn off the heat. </li>
        <li>Squeeze in some fresh lemon juice. Garnish poha with more cilantro and sev serve with a cuppa chai.</li>

    </ol>
